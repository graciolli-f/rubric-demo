I'll help you add a task description field to the existing task model and display it in the UI. Let me first examine the current implementation to understand the structure.
Read file: src/models/task.ts
Read file: src/stores/task-store.ts
Read file: src/views/task-view.tsx
Read file: src/app.tsx

Now I understand the current structure. I'll add a task description field to the model and update the UI to display it. Let me create a task list to track this work:

Let me start implementing the changes. First, I'll update the task model to include the description field:

Perfect! Now I'll update the TaskStore to handle the description parameter:

Great! Now I'll update the TaskView component to include a description input field and display descriptions in the task list:

Perfect! Let me mark the remaining tasks as completed:

Excellent! I've successfully added a task description field to your existing task model and updated the UI to display it. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Task Model** (`src/models/task.ts`)
- Added `description: string` field to the `ITask` interface
- Updated `TaskModel` class with description handling:
  - Added private `_description` field
  - Updated constructor to accept description parameter
  - Added description getter
  - Updated `toggle()` method to preserve description

### 2. **Task Store** (`src/stores/task-store.ts`)
- Modified `addTask()` method to accept an optional description parameter (defaults to empty string)
- Updated `getTasks()` method to include description in returned task objects

### 3. **Task View UI** (`src/views/task-view.tsx`)
- Added a textarea input field for task descriptions in the form
- Updated form submission to pass both title and description to the store
- Enhanced task list display to show descriptions:
  - Task titles are now **bold**
  - Descriptions appear below titles in smaller, *italic*, gray text
  - Descriptions only show when they exist (not empty)

## Features:
- ✅ **Optional descriptions** - users can add descriptions when creating tasks
- ✅ **Clean UI** - descriptions are visually distinct from titles
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** - existing functionality is preserved
- ✅ **Conditional display** - descriptions only show when provided

You can now create tasks with rich descriptions and they'll be displayed elegantly in the task list!
