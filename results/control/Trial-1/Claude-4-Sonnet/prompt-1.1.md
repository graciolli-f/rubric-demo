Add a task description field to the existing task model and display it in the UI.

## Chat Response
I'll help you add a task description field to the existing task model and display it in the UI. Let me start by exploring the current task implementation to understand the structure.
Read file: src/models/task.ts
Read file: src/stores/task-store.ts
Read file: src/views/task-view.tsx

Now I understand the current structure. I need to add a description field to the task model and update the UI to support it. Let me implement these changes step by step.

Now I need to update the task store to handle the description field:

Finally, I need to update the task view to support the description field in the UI:

I've successfully added a task description field to your existing task model and updated the UI to support it. Here's what I implemented:

## Changes Made:

### 1. Task Model (`src/models/task.ts`)
- Added `description` field to the `ITask` interface
- Updated `TaskModel` class to include description handling:
  - Added private `_description` field 
  - Updated constructor to accept description parameter (defaults to empty string)
  - Added getter for description field
  - Modified `toggle()` method to preserve description

### 2. Task Store (`src/stores/task-store.ts`) 
- Updated `addTask()` method to accept optional description parameter
- Modified `getTasks()` to include description in returned task objects

### 3. Task View (`src/views/task-view.tsx`)
- Added state management for description input (`newTaskDescription`)
- Added description input field to the form with placeholder "Task description (optional)..."
- Updated form submission to pass description when creating tasks
- Added UI display for descriptions below task titles when they exist
- Styled descriptions with gray color, italic font, smaller size, and left margin

## Features:
- **Optional descriptions**: The description field is optional - existing tasks continue to work
- **Clean UI**: Descriptions appear below task titles with subtle styling
- **Form handling**: Both title and description inputs are cleared after adding a task
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing functionality is preserved

You can now add detailed descriptions to your tasks for better organization and context!
